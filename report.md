# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Security Review: MavBudgetz

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Findings:**
- Uses Firebase Authentication (good choice).
- No evidence of role-based access control (RBAC) or fine-grained permissions.
- Sensitive actions (like deleting budgets/expenses) are performed client-side and may be vulnerable if backend rules are not enforced.

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce all sensitive operations with Firebase Security Rules on the backend.
- Implement RBAC if you plan to have admin or privileged users.
- Never trust client-side checks for authorization.

---

## 2. Firestore Security Rules

**Findings:**
- No Firestore security rules shown in codebase.
- By default, Firestore is open unless rules are set.

**Recommendations:**
- Set Firestore rules to only allow users to read/write their own data:
  ```js
  match /budgets/{budgetId} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  }
  match /expenses/{expenseId} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  }
  match /savingsGoals/{goalId} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  }
  ```
- Regularly review and test your security rules.

## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

**Findings:**
- User data is stored in Firestore.
- No evidence of sensitive data (like passwords or payment info) being stored insecurely.
- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit.

**Recommendations:**
- Rely on Firebase‚Äôs built-in encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Never store sensitive data (like plaintext passwords or payment card numbers) in Firestore.
- If you add file uploads (e.g., receipt images), secure Firebase Storage with rules.

---

## 4. Dependency & Supply Chain Security

**Findings:**
- Uses many third-party packages (e.g., `file-saver`, `html2pdf.js`, `marked`, etc.).
- Some vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit` (including 1 critical).

**Recommendations:**
- Run `npm audit fix` regularly and address all critical vulnerabilities.
- Remove unused dependencies.
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot.

---

## 5. Input Validation & Injection

**Findings:**
- Uses Zod schemas for form validation (good).
- No evidence of server-side validation for all user input (especially if you add custom backend endpoints).

**Recommendations:**
- Always validate and sanitize all user input on both client and server.
- Use parameterized queries if you ever add custom backend code.

---

## 6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Findings:**
- Uses React, which escapes output by default.
- Uses `marked` to convert markdown to HTML for PDF reports. If user input is ever included in markdown, this could be a vector for XSS.

**Recommendations:**
- Sanitize all markdown input before converting to HTML (use `dompurify` or similar).
- Never render raw HTML from untrusted sources.

---

## 7. Session Management

**Findings:**
- Relies on Firebase Auth for session management, which is secure if configured properly.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure session tokens are stored securely (prefer HttpOnly cookies if possible).
- Set up session expiration and re-authentication for sensitive actions.

---

## 8. Logging & Monitoring

**Findings:**
- No evidence of logging or monitoring for suspicious activity.

**Recommendations:**
- Use Firebase‚Äôs built-in logging and enable alerts for suspicious activity (e.g., rapid reads/writes, failed logins).
- Consider integrating with a SIEM for advanced monitoring if the app grows.

---

## 9. Data Export & Report Generation

**Findings:**
- CSV and PDF exports are generated client-side.
- If any sensitive data is included, ensure only the authenticated user can trigger and access their own exports.

**Recommendations:**
- Double-check that only the logged-in user can export their own data.
- Sanitize all data before including in reports.

## Summary Table

| Area                     | Risk Level | Recommendation Summary                                 |
|--------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Auth & Authorization     | Medium     | Enforce backend rules, consider RBAC                   |
| Firestore Rules          | High       | Lock down to user data only                            |
| Data Exposure            | Low        | Use Firebase encryption, avoid sensitive data storage   |
| Dependencies             | Medium     | Fix vulnerabilities, monitor supply chain              |
| Input Validation         | Medium     | Validate/sanitize on both client and server            |
| XSS                      | Medium     | Sanitize markdown, never render raw HTML               |
| Session Management       | Low        | Use secure tokens, set expirations                     |
| Logging & Monitoring     | Medium     | Enable Firebase logging and alerts                     |
| Data Export              | Low        | Restrict to user, sanitize data                        |

## Next Steps

1. **Review and update Firestore security rules.**
2. **Fix all critical npm vulnerabilities.**
3. **Add markdown sanitization for PDF reports.**
4. **Regularly review dependencies and monitor for new threats.**
5. **Consider adding logging/monitoring for suspicious activity.**
